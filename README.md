Crypto Price Tracker - Detailed Documentation 
 
Project Overview 
 
The Crypto Price Tracker is a modern web application built with Next.js that provides realtime cryptocurrency market data. The application fetches information from multiple cryptocurrency APIs and presents it in a user-friendly interface with robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. 
 
Key Features 
 
•	Live Cryptocurrency Data: Real-time prices, market cap, and 24h changes 
•	Multi-API Architecture: Uses multiple data sources with automatic failover 
•	Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices 
•	Dark/Light Mode: Theme support with system preference detection 
•	Search Functionality: Filter cryptocurrencies by name or symbol 
•	Manual Refresh: Update data on demand 
•	Resilient Error Handling: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms 
 
Technical Architecture 
Technology Stack 
 
•	Frontend Framework: Next.js 13.5 with App Router 
•	UI Library: React 18.2 
•	Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components 
•	State Management: React Context API 
•	Data Fetching: Custom fetch implementation with retry logic 
•	Theming: next-themes for dark/light mode support 
 
 
 
 
Component Structure 
The application follows a component-based architecture: 
 
Layout Components: 
 
•	RootLayout: Base layout with theme provider 
•	DocsLayout: Layout for documentation pages 
 
Page Components: 
 
•	HomePage: Main cryptocurrency tracking page 
•	DocsPage: Documentation and help information 
 
Feature Components: 
 
•	CryptoPageClient: Client-side wrapper for crypto components 
•	CryptoProvider: Context provider for cryptocurrency data 
•	CryptoTable: Displays cryptocurrency data in tabular format 
•	SearchBar: Handles search and refresh functionality 
•	ModeToggle: Switches between light and dark themes 
 
UI Components: 
 
•	Various shadcn/ui components (Button, Table, Progress, etc.) 
 
 
 
Data Flow Architecture 
API Integration 
 
The application implements a sophisticated API integration strategy: 
 
 
•	Primary Data Source: CoinGecko API 
•	Fallback Sources: CoinPaprika, CoinLore, and Coinranking APIs 
•	Last Resort: Mock data with realistic variations 
 
 
The data fetching process follows this sequence: 
 
•	Check cache for fresh data (< 60 seconds old) 
•	Try CoinGecko API with retry logic 
•	If failed, try CoinPaprika API with retry logic 
•	If failed, try CoinLore API with retry logic 
•	If failed, try Coinranking API with retry logic 
•	If all APIs fail, use mock data 
 
 
CORS Handling 
 
To overcome CORS restrictions, the application implements a proxy rotation system: 
 
•	First attempts direct API calls 
•	If CORS errors occur, tries multiple proxy services: 
api.allorigins.win 
corsproxy.io 
cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com 
 
 
 
 
 
State Management 
 
The application uses React's Context API for state management through a custom hook: 
 
This hook provides: 
 
•	Cryptocurrency data access 
•	Loading state information 
•	Search functionality 
•	Data refresh capability 
•	Mock data status 
 
 
 
Resilience Features 
 
Error Handling 
The application implements comprehensive error handling: 
 
API Failure Detection: 
 
•	Tracks failed APIs to avoid repeated failures 
•	Implements timeouts to prevent hanging requests 
 
Retry Mechanism: 
 
•	Exponential backoff with jitter 
•	Maximum 3 retries per API with increasing delays 
 
 
 
Graceful Degradation: 
 
•	Falls back to cached data when available 
•	Uses mock data when all APIs fail 
•	Visual indicators for fallback states 
 
 
Performance Optimization 
 
Caching Strategy: 
 
•	Client-side caching to reduce API calls 
•	Cache duration: 60 seconds for normal operation 
 
Request Management: 
 
•	Debounced search to prevent excessive filtering 
•	Request timeouts to prevent hanging operations 
•	Concurrent request prevention 
 
 
User Interface 
 
Responsive Design 
 
   
The application is fully responsive: 
 
•	Fluid layouts that adapt to screen size 
•	Mobile-optimized table view 
•	Responsive search and filter components 
•	Theme Support 
 
 
Implements dark/light mode with: 
 
•	System preference detection 
•	Manual theme toggle 
•	Persistent theme selection 
•	Visual Feedback 
Provides clear visual feedback for all states: 
 
•	Loading indicators with progress 
•	Error notifications via toast messages 
•	Mock data warnings 
•	Last updated timestamp 
 
 
Implementation Highlights 
API Fallback System 
 
The application implements a sophisticated fallback system that tries multiple API sources in sequence, with retry logic for each source. This ensures that the application can continue to function even when some APIs are unavailable. 
 
CORS Proxy Rotation 
 
The application uses a proxy rotation system to overcome CORS restrictions. It tries direct API calls first, then falls back to multiple proxy services if needed. 
 
Loading Progress Simulation 
 
To provide a better user experience during API calls, the application implements a simulated progress indicator that gives users visual feedback on the loading process. 
 
Deployment 
 
The application is configured for static site generation with Next.js: 
 
Future Enhancements 
 
Planned improvements include: 
 
•	Data Visualization: Add price charts and historical data 
•	Personalization: Implement watchlists and favorites 
•	Advanced Filtering: Add sorting and additional filters 
•	Offline Support: Enhance offline capabilities with Service Workers 
•	Real-time Updates: Implement WebSocket connections for live updates 
•	Mobile App: Develop a dedicated mobile application with React Native 
•	Authentication: Add user accounts for personalized experiences 
•	Additional Data: Include more cryptocurrency metrics and information 

Conclusion 
 
The Crypto Price Tracker demonstrates a robust approach to building resilient web applications that handle unreliable external APIs. By implementing multiple fallback mechanisms, comprehensive error handling, and a thoughtful user experience, the application provides reliable cryptocurrency data even in challenging network conditions.
